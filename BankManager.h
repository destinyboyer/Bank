	The BankManager class is a high level class that manages the interactions between 
	Binary Search Tree of Clients and a queue of Transactions. This class will also log
	the Transactions that have been completed so that they can be undone if necessary.
	Note that this class manages interactions, and relies on the BinarySearchTree, Client,
	and Transaction classes to throw any errors pertaining to the suitability of data.

			- clients.buildTree(ifstream&) is called and the file stream is passed to it
			- buildTree(ifstream&) creates new Client objects, passing the file stream
			  to each new Client and inserting the Client in to the clients BinarySearchTree
			  until the end-of-file is reached

		PRECONDITIONS:
			- file must contain data formatted for Client objects
		
		POSTCONDITIONS:
			- reads from file to fill the clients BinarySearchTree

		This function completes all Transactions in the transaction queue. The function pops a
		transaction off of the transaction queue, finds the appropriate clients, and passes
		the information to the clients to carry out the transaction. The transaction is then moved
		to the Transaction stack to log that it has been completed and allow for transactions
		to be undone.

		Flow of Program:
			- transact(void) pops a Transaction object off of pending
			- program searches clients by account number via the retrieve method call on clients
			- program has both Client objects perform the appropriate transaction
			- data is handed to both Clients for them to log necessary transaction data
			- Transaction is moved to the completed

			- this class is not responsible for handling errors pertaining to Transactions
